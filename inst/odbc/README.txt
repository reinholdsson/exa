1. Installation

The tar archive can be unpacked anywhere - no special installation is
necessary. To ensure the integrity of the package, always unpack on the target
system and with the proper tools:

Linux and Mac OS X:
    tar -xzf EXASolution_ODBC.tar.gz
Solaris:
    gtar -xzf EXASolution_ODBC.tar.gz
AIX and HP-UX:
    uncompress -c EXASolution_ODBC.tar.Z | tar -xf -


AIX only:
    The driver requires some additional software. If missing, download from
    http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/software/aix/linux/toolbox/download.html
    and install the following packages:

    AIX 6.1 and AIX 7.1:
        * libgcc 4.2.0 for AIX 6.1
        * libstdc++ 4.2.0 for AIX 6.1

==============================================================================

2. Configuration

Run the provided config_odbc program to generate an ODBC ini file:

    $ ./config_odbc

The generated ODBC ini file will contain DSN entries for all supported ODBC
driver managers (unixODBC and DataDirect on AIX, HP-UX, Linux, and Solaris;
iODBC on Mac OS X). Please consult

    $ ./config_odbc --help

for details.

The config_odbc program includes connection testing and tries to guess the
correct DSN for running applications.

==============================================================================

3. Necessary environment settings

Under some circumstances it is necessary to set some environment variables.
The shell script exaodbc_wrapper generated by config_odbc can serve as a
starting point for doing that. 

Sometimes it is not possible to control the library search path of an
application. In that case, add symbolic links to the driver's helper
libraries to the application's library directory:

    $ ln -s /path/to/driver/lib/dir/* /application/lib/dir/

Have a look in exaodbc_wrapper for what is the correct path for a given DSN.
